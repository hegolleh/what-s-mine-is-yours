      <h3>Observation</h3>
      <p>Throughout the observations, interviews, and the literature review a lot of the information I have observed and found go back to the idea of collaborative consumption such as my observation with the shopping carts, shared spaces of libraries, and open access.
Within my observations of the parking lot of a grocery srtore, I observed how individuals treat their shopping carts after they had no use for them anymore. I sat in the parking lot at the wall of the store at 9:00 am to 11:00 am and again at 8:00 pm to 12:00 am on a weekday. as I observed the individuals, most people we in pair rather than groups or solo. in the mornings while the store was busier, people were more likely to out up their shopping carts in the designated place in the parking lot. as it became less busy throughout the say I noticed that peoplewould get rid of their cart in a more inappropriate manner like in parking spaces near their car or just in the way of traffic. At one point when the store was least busy and I was stationed outside the store, people were more likely to hesitate before discarding their cart inappropriately. assuming my presense was influencing my observation, I got in my car and observed outside of the environment. again, people began to confidently discard their carts in parking spaces. I found that the presence of other people deterrs individuals from doing things that are seen as “wrong” or “inappropriate” such as washing your hands in a batheroom when your around other versus not washing your hands when alone. overall I observed four differe nt types of individuals; the always returner, the pressure returner, the convenience returner, and the never returner.</p></div>
